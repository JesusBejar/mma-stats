# MMA Stats
# Overview
This simple fullstack React/Supabase app calls MMA fighter and fight stats from the [MMA Stats API](https://rapidapi.com/chirikutsikuda/api/mma-stats). A user can see detailed fighter information as well as fights that happened within a calendar year. The user can also save favorite fighters and fights for further analysis. 

My purpose was to make a good React app that sports fan could use by myself. I really like MMA so I decided to make the app revolve around it however I could have chosen any sports API. I'm happy to have made the app with more comprehensive than any another React app I've made before :)

# Web Pages
* Home Page - Where users can search and save specific fighters and fights
* Saved Fighters - Where saved fighters show up and can be unsaved
* Saved Fights - Where saved fights show up and can be unsaved

# Development Environment
My stack was React, Javascript, HTML, CSS (not Tailwind) and Supabase

# Future Work
* Auth system (I think I will use [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) to make it easy)
* Find and implement a better API (MMA stats API has some missing data)
* Optimize more for mobile and accessability views
